# 👋 Hey, I'm Miko26xx

Welcome to my little corner of the internet!  
I'm a curious coder, a Roblox enjoyer, and a professional button-clicker.  
If I’m not learning something new, I’m probably breaking something that used to work 😄

## 🌟 Who Am I?

I’m just a guy who jumped into coding because I wanted to make cool stuff —  
games, websites, scripts, or random experiments that probably shouldn’t work but somehow do.

Here’s the vibe:

- 🎮 Roblox player, creator, and explorer *(still learning but having fun)*  
- 🔧 Loves tinkering with code until it behaves  
- 🙃 Has 30 unfinished projects but still starts new ones  
- 🌐 Not very active on X, but hey, I'm *there*  
- 💡 Fascinated by:
  - Game development  
  - Web design  
  - Scripting  
  - Automation  
  - Anything with buttons
